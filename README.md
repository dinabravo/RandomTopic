# RandomTopic

Random Topic is an app that will randomly select a topic to talk about based on the current news.
The app uses NewsAPI https://newsapi.org/ to fetch all the news and sources. It displays all the topics in the settings section so based on what the user picked the suggested topics will display accordingly.
